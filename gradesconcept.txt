now for each data or student
make the user select where to save the files
after selecting the target location, use folders to separate
like this
...SF9(folder) > (store the sf9 files here)
...SF10(folder) > (store the sf10 files here)
after selecting the target location copy the SF9 and SF10 template (template is located on the same file as where this py file is located)
and for each student/data make a copy for each one, and edit them with their details, below is provided what and where to edit
the file name of each one must be their LRN so its unique and won't cause any problems

now for each student transfer the names from column B (MFQ1.xlsx) to Q22 (SF9.xlsb)
